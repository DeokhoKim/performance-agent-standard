# Create Pull Request Skill

Def: Purpose → Create a pull request from HEAD to target branch programmatically, handling detached HEAD and generating optimized descriptions.

Section: Invocation Parameters

- `[target]`: Optional. Target branch to compare and open the PR against. Defaults to the repository's default branch.
- `[draft/ready]`: Optional. PR status. Defaults to `draft`.
- `[language]`: Optional. Target language for the PR title and description. Defaults to Korean (한국어).

Section: Execution Flow

Step: 1. Pre-flight Validation:
- Run `scripts/pre-pr-check.sh [target]` (pass `[target]` only if specified).
- Rule: Agent MUST NOT run any manual git/gh inspection commands (e.g., `git log`, `git diff`, `git branch`, `gh repo view`). Rely entirely on `pre-pr-check.sh` for all environment and context data.
- Rule: If script exits non-zero → display stderr, suggest action, and stop.
- Parse stdout as `KEY=value` pairs: `TARGET_BRANCH`, `RESOLVED_TARGET`, `CURRENT_BRANCH`, `IS_DETACHED`, `IS_TRIVIAL`, `COMMITS_FILE`, `DIFF_FILE`, `DIFF_LINES`.

Step: 2. Branch Checkout (if detached):
- If `IS_DETACHED=true`: generate a short descriptive branch name from `COMMITS_FILE` content.
- Rule: Execute `git checkout -b <branch-name>` immediately. Update `CURRENT_BRANCH` to the new name.

Step: 3. Remote Push:
- Rule: Execute `git push -u origin <CURRENT_BRANCH>`.

Step: 4. PR Message Generation:
- Read `COMMITS_FILE` and `DIFF_FILE` (paths provided by `pre-pr-check.sh` output). Do NOT run any git commands to re-collect this data.
- Evaluate whether commit messages are comprehensive (subject + explanatory body).
- Rule: If comprehensive → derive PR title and description from commits only.
- Rule: If NOT comprehensive or `IS_TRIVIAL=false` → derive PR title and description from `DIFF_FILE`.
- Format: If no workspace-specific PR template is provided, follow this structured format:
  1. **Summary**: Explain what the changes are, what they affect, and what they mean for the project.
  2. **Concerns**: Note potential risks, regressions, or areas requiring careful review.
  3. **Key Changes**: Provide a bulleted list of the most significant code changes.
- Rule: Always prioritize and respect any workspace-specific PR template if one exists. Fall back to the structured format above only if no template is found.
- Language: Generate in `[language]` (default Korean).

Step: 5. PR Creation:
- Rule: Execute `gh pr create --base <TARGET_BRANCH>` with the generated title and body.
- Flag: Append `--draft` unless `[draft/ready]` is explicitly `ready`.
